                      General
                      
                      These General Terms apply generally to the use of the service Klubmeet (the "Service" or “Klubmeet”), and constitute a contract between you and the company Klubmeet ("The Company"). These terms govern your access to and use of the Klubmeet application and website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content"). Parts of the Service may display Content that is not Klubmeet's (“User Content”). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that has made it available. When "Content" is used in this document, it refers to both content provided by Klubmeet and User Content collectively, unless otherwise specified.
                      
                      
                      Where applicable, "The Company" shall also be understood as a reference to affiliates, suppliers, partners and other third parties Klubmeet may engage or otherwise cooperate with in connection with the Service
                      
                      
                      By using Klubmeet you agree to these General Terms and the Privacy Policy (collectively referred to as "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to the Terms, you can’t use Klubmeet.
                      
                      
                      We may change these Terms at any time. If a change is material, we’ll let you know before it takes effect provided that we have your correct email address. By using Klubmeet on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree to them, you should delete your account before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Service and Content will be subject to the new Terms.
                      
                      
                      Scope of Klubmeet services
                      
                      
                      
                      As the provider of the Klubmeet Service, Klubmeet does not own, create, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver, or supply any Host Services. Hosts alone are responsible for their Listings and Host Services. When Members make or accept a booking, they are entering into a contract directly with each other. Klubmeet is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members. Klubmeet is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except for collecting Services fees, as described in this document.
                      
                      
                      
                      You might be using Klubmeet Service to create an individual profile, and provide services, as defined in this document, over paid-for video calls (referred as “Host”), or seek such services (referred as “User”).
                      
                      
                      
                      While we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes, Klubmeet has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the truth or accuracy of any Listing descriptions, Ratings, Reviews, or other Member Content, or (ii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Klubmeet does not endorse any Member, Listing or Host Services. Any references to a Member being "verified" (or similar language) only indicate that the Member has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. Any such description is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Klubmeet about any Member, including of the Member's identity or background or whether the Member is trustworthy, safe or suitable.
                      
                      
                      Age limitation
                      Klubmeet is only for people 21 or older if they are residing in the United States, and 18 or older if they are residing anywhere else. By using Klubmeet, you affirm that you are over the age limit effective for your country of residence. If we learn that someone under the minimum allowed age is using Klubmeet, we’ll terminate their account. For use in educational or other settings, contact us.
                      
                      
                      How you can use the Service
                      Your use of Klubmeet requires that you have hardware, software and an Internet connection fulfilling certain recommended requirements, as may be specified in our Support Center. If the recommended requirements are not met, you may potentially still use the Service, but normally with a lower quality or performance. Such reduced quality or performance will not give you the right to claim any compensation from Klubmeet.
                      
                      
                      To use the Service, you will need to create a personal Klubmeet account. You may register an account by following the instructions on the Website or other instructions prompted to you. You are responsible for providing and maintaining accurate and updated personal information, and for safeguarding your account information. You may not select or use an identity of another person with the intent to impersonate that person. You must use a valid email address, and Klubmeet reserves the right to verify this at any time. Klubmeet will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements.
                      
                      
                      Your account is strictly personal and shall not be used by any other person without your supervision. Neither shall you assign your account to any other person. You are in any event solely responsible for the use of the Service through your personal user account.
                      
                      
                      We may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the Service or your account, at any time, without notice. We reserve the right to impose limitations of use based on what we consider fair or legitimate usage.
                      
                      
                      You are responsible for your use of Klubmeet, including the lawfulness of any content displayed, shared, uploaded or otherwise made available by you in the Service (“the User Content”).
                      
                      
                      Video services for Klubmeet, are provided by Nexmo Inc., a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business at 23 Main Street, Holmdel, New Jersey 07733, USA (Vonage), and are subject to the Vonage Terms of Service.
